# Flipr_Hackathon-
This repository is of the app which I had to submit in the Flipr hackathon in which I participated. In the hackathon it was asked to create a *Kanban Style* app which is similar to that of Trello. So basically they asked to create a clone of Trello with some extra features. I tried my best to create a similar app with all my technical capabilities.
