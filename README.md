# Flipr_Hackathon-
This repository is of the app which I had to submit in the Flipr hackathon in which I participated. In the hackathon it was asked to create a *Kanban Style* app which is similar to that of Trello. So basically they asked to create a clone of Trello with some extra features. I tried my best to create a similar app with all my technical capabilities despite the hackathon being just 2 days long. 

# Technical Information-
I have made this app using Android studio and integrating it with Firebase database. I have added in the same Firebase [Login-Register](https://github.com/Dhruv-194/Login-Register-app) system for the user authentication. And then also used the Firebase database to upload users data and all the information given by him/her. Apart from this, Firebase database is also used to store the information put by the user in the lists and the cards.
